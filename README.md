* [Pentel Graphgear 500 (Blue) 0.7](https://www.amazon.com/Pentel-GraphGear-Automatic-Drafting-PG525A/dp/B0006OM2RE/)


* [Prismacolor Premier Colored Pencils, Soft Core, 72-Count](https://www.amazon.com/Prismacolor-Premier-Colored-Pencils-72-Count/dp/B000E23RSQ/)



NOTE: I used to love Staedtler as a teen / young adult but I've switched to the Graphgear 500


* [Staedtler Mars 780 Technical Mechanical Pencil, 2mm](https://www.amazon.com/Staedtler-Technical-Mechanical-Pencil-780BK/dp/B000YQEFGU/)


You probably also need:

* [Staedtler Mars Rotary Action Lead Pointer and Tub for 2mm Leads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EL9J50/)


# = Lead =

* [Pentel Super Hi-Polymer Lead Refill , 0.7 mm Medium, HB, 90 Pieces](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016P2A5G/)

#   = Pens =

I found `Fine 0.7 mm` is the perfect _balanced_ size. Not too thin, not too thick.


* [Pilot G2 Retractable Premium Gel Ink Roller Ball Pens, Fine Point, 4-Pack, Assorted Colors, Black/Blue/Red/Green](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Retractable-Premium-Roller-31299/dp/B001CD7K84/)

# = Erasers =

* [Prismacolor Magic Rub Vinyl Drafting Erasers, 12-Count](https://www.amazon.com/Prismacolor-Magic-Drafting-Erasers-12-Count/dp/B00006IFAY/)


White eraser quality is all over the map. Staedtler Mars is great.


* [Staedtler Mars Plastic Erasers,Pack of 4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NC5MW7O/)



# = Paper =

## Non-Graph Paper


* [9-3/4 x 7-1/2" Top Flight Sewn Composition Book, Black and White Marble, Wide Rule](https://www.amazon.com/Top-Flight-Composition-Marble-Sheets/dp/B005RTDDM6/)



Yellow Legal Pad -- You need to determine _which_ yellow is right for you. **90% of the yellows are crap.** Too dim, too bright, spacing too narrow, spacing too wide. Pick something YOU _like._


* [TOPS The Legal Pad Legal Pad, 8-1/2 x 11-3/4 Inches, Perforated, Canary, Legal/Wide Rule, 50 Sheets per Pad, 12 Pads per Pack](https://www.amazon.com/Legal-Inches-Perforated-Canary-Sheets/dp/B0006HWRK8/)


## Graph Paper

* [9.75x7.5" Top Flight Sewn Marble Composition Book, Black/White, Quad Rule](https://www.amazon.com/Top-Flight-Composition-Squares-41320/dp/B003I869B0/)



**NOTE:** Brand doesn't mater (Staples, Ampad, etc.) as long as it is: 

 * Pad
 * Double Sided
 * White
 * 4x4 Quad Rule
 * 50 sheets


   * [8.5 x 11](https://www.amazon.com/Section-Squares-Quadrille-Letter-35041/dp/B00094AMAU/)

   * [11 x 17](https://www.amazon.com/Ampad-Quadrille-Double-Sheets-22-037/dp/B00275QXLG/)



# = Rulers =

## Solid

* [Classics 12" Stainless Steel Ruler with Cork Backing](https://www.amazon.com/Classics-Stainless-Steel-Backing-TPG-152/dp/B010CEEQTY/)



## Transparent


I snapped a 12" transparent one in half, accidently, but have this one on order.

* [Transparent 6" Ruler](https://www.amazon.com/eBoot-Plastic-Straight-Rulers-Transparent/dp/B06XHHHF51/)


# = Containers =


I prefer this one because it has a low profile height and can hold 6 pens laying next to each other across.

* [Super Stacker Pencil Box](https://www.amazon.com/ADVANTUS-Stacker-Pencil-Inches-34365/dp/B00NU7NWGO/)


**NOTE:** Above is a _random_ color -- freaking STUPID customer service!!!

I bought mine at Fred Meyer because I could _see_ and _pick_ which color I wanted.

  * Red
  * Green
  * Blue
  * Purple
  * Clear

I do NOT recommend the ...

* [Sterilite Pencil Box with Splash Tint Lid](https://www.amazon.com/Sterilite-Pencil-Splash-Tint-17224812/dp/B00453MS12/)

... as the latch has a tendancy to unlock.


# = Shelves =
